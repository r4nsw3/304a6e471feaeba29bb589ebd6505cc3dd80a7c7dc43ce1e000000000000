  |   Did it take a village to finish Minecraft's biggest update yet? Oh    |
  |   pah-lease. It took so much more! It took hardworking developers,      |
  |   pixel artists, that wonderful person who keeps the office fridge      |
  |   stocked, far too many employees to thank here, and most of all -      |
  |   you! - the players, giving us your constant feedback every step of    |
  |   the way. You helped make Village & Pillage an update we couldn't be   |
  |   more proud of.                                                        |

  |   Pillagers! What can I say? I love a good scrap, and so do the         |
  |   newest mob to enter Minecraft, even if they're not too bright.        |
  |   Quick, craft a brand-new crossbow before they attack you with         |
  |   theirs!                                                               |

  |   The Wandering Trader! A mysterious merchant who travels the lands     |
  |   in search of sales. Sure, I could waste more of my life telling you   |
  |   all about this sales savant, but why bother when I can just link      |
  |   you to this ace video all about the Wandering Trader instead? Or      |
  |   this brilliant article written by Per 'you better mention I also      |
  |   worked on that video' Landin?                                         |

  |   New villager trades! You'll find villagers busy beavering away at     |
  |   their new jobs in each village you visit, and we'll have a deep       |
  |   dive into all their new occupations this Saturday!                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Known Issue: some mobs are bugged and might look like new villagers   |
  |   in some Marketplace maps. We're working on a hotfix and we want to    |
  |   get it out to you as soon as we can - please don't open these         |
  |   worlds until then. See aka.ms/brokenworlds for more information.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Please note that there is a bug that currently affects HD texture     |
  |   packs on mobile devices. Using these texture packs may cause your     |
  |   game to crash. Until we get this bug fixed, we advise you to not      |
  |   use HD texture packs on mobile devices. We hope to get this bug       |
  |   fixed soon!                                                           |
